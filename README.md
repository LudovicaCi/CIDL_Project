# Computational Intelligence and Deep Learnig Project
## Emotion detection from images

## Introduction to the project
Emotion recognition from facial images is an increasingly significant task across various domains. The objective of this paper is to tackle the emotion recognition classification problem using facial images. Deep Learning methodologies like Transfer learning and custom-trained Neural Networks, are employed to address this task. The classifier aims to distinguish the following emotions: happiness, neutrality, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, and fear.

## Dataset Details

The dataset used to develop this project was sourced from Kaggle. Here are the dataset details:

- **Source:** [Kaggle - FER2013 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013)
