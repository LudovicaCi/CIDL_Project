# Computational Intelligence and Deep Learnig Project
## Emotion detection from images

## Development Environment

This project was developed using the Google Colab environment for ease of sharing and collaboration. Jupyter notebooks are available on Google Colab and can be run directly in the cloud.

To run the notebooks on Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. Open the desired notebook in the repository.
2. Click on the Google Colab icon (![Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)) at the top of the notebook.
3. The notebook will open on Google Colab, ready for execution.

## Introduction to the project
Emotion recognition from facial images is an increasingly significant task across various domains. The objective of this paper is to tackle the emotion recognition classification problem using facial images. Deep Learning methodologies like Transfer learning and custom-trained Neural Networks, are employed to address this task. The classifier aims to distinguish the following emotions: happiness, neutrality, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, and fear.
